      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Tackett Brothers Hauling was founded in 2015 by two brothers with a mission to provide fast, reliable, and professional hauling services to Columbus-area businesses. What started as a local operation has grown into the trusted choice for pallet and scrap removal throughout central Ohio.</p>
      
      <p>We understand that businesses need dependable hauling partners who show up on time, work efficiently, and treat property with respect. That's the Tackett Brothers difference.</p>
